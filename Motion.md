# Motion ðŸš¶
## Vectors and scalars
distance is a scalar while displacement is a vector
### Vectors
Vectors have a size(Magnitude) and a direction 
### Scalars
A scalar only has a magnitude
Scalars include Length, area, Volume, Speed, Mass 
## Distance time graphs
`Distance = Average Speed x Time`
`Average Speed (m/s) = Distance (m)/Time taken (s)`
Distance time graphs can be used to find Average speed Distance and time of a journey
## Acceleration
```
When an object is falling due to
gravity its acceleration due to
gravity is 10 m/s^2
```
`(final velocity)2 â€“ (initial velocity)2 = 2 Ã— acceleration Ã— distance`
