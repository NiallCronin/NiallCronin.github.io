# Motion
## Vectors and scalars
distance is a scalar while displacement is a vector
### Vectors
Vectors have a size(Magnitude) and a direction 
### Scalars
A scalar only has a magnitude
Scalars include Length, area, Volume, Speed, Mass 
## Distance time graphs
## Acceleration
## Velocity time graphs
